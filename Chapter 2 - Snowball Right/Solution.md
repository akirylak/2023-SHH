## Chapter 2 Challenge: Snowball Fight
### Location: Christmas Island / Frosty Beach
Thank you SANS for providing some directions to Frosty Beach. I am not a sailor nor would I ever be commandeering a ship. The GPS signals here are very good compared to other places I have been near an ocean.

Upon arriving on Frosty Beach, I wasn’t sure who to be excited about; meeting Santa in person or meeting a goose who wasn’t trying to chase me for a bite of my lunch. After an introduction of Santa’s operations on Geese Islands, the use of Chat NPT and an introduction to the challenge. I don’t blame Santa for taking a break and moving operations to a warmer climate. I do not live near the North Pole, yet where I am with the heat on, I wish I was near the equator around this time of year. I was recommended to speak to **Morsel Nougat** about a **Snowball Fight** and to stop by **Santa’s Surf Shack.**

To those that are reading this report, anytime there are booths in a CTF like this, always worth checking out. Great to have as bookmarks in your browser to review later when you need a break from a CTF or if you prefer to reference them later. Very happy to see AWS is a vendor on this island.

Navigating to the otherside of the island, I ran into Morsel Nougat. It is awesome to know that Santa and the elfs can take a break from their duties to participate in a snowball fight.

### Solving the Challenge
Morsel gave some great pointers related to how to solve this challenge including some key words

**“Santa, some elves, and I are having a snowball fight, and we'd love you to join us. Santa's really good, so trust me when I say it's way more fun when played with other people.**

**But hey, if you can figure out a way to play solo by tinkering with client side variables or parameters to go solo mode, go for it!**

**There's also ways to make the elves' snowballs do no damage, and all kinds of other shenanigans, but you didn't hear that from me.**

**Just remember, it's all about having fun and sharing the joy of the holiday season with each other.”**

Clicking on the snowball fight, I decided to try to play the game a few times to see how the mechanics work and to have a little fun. Afterall, it was 10:00 PM, so I needed to have a little fun.

After playing for 30 minutes, I got lucky with one other player. We were able to defeat all of the elves and defeat Santa in a snowball fight. Although it took us two tries to do it, we were able to accomplish this without needing to modify any client-side variables or parameters in the browser window. It should be noted, we were able to keep our health bar up by circling around the map to keep a safe distance from the elves and Santa. It is safe to say, it was teamwork that helped us complete the game fair and square.

### Solution Performed
Played the game with another player with the power of strategy and teamwork.

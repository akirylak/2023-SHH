# SANS HOLIDAY HACK 2023: SimonCypherSays Report
## Chapter 8 Challenge: Luggage Lock
### Location: Island of Misfit Toys / Squarewheel Yard
There was an evening where my boyfriend was wondering why I was spending so much time after dinner on my computer focusing on completing the challenges and writing up my reports. He was curious on what each of the challenges entails and I found one that I challenged him to complete after I solved this one on my own.

**Luggage Lock Decode** is a challenge that utilizes less hacking skills and is more informational and fun to perform. The youtube video provided by SANS https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycM1hBSEyog gives instructions on how to complete this challenge. This does require a bit of trial and error to complete the challenge. It was easy enough to figure out and challenged my boyfriend, who has no CTF experience, to have a go at luggage lock to see if he can figure it out. He did it in less time than I did [insert facepalm].

### How to complete the challenge:
1.  Start with one wheel and work your way up to four wheels.

2.  Apply pressure on the lock by using the spacebar. There are 5 modes of resistance that can be applied to the lock. We found resistance of 3-4 spacebar clicks.

3.  Use the [Q,A],[W,S],[E,D], or [R,F] keys to scroll up and down the wheel until you receive a response of resistance.

4.  Hit the spacebar until either of the two actions occur:
5.  The zipper opens and you complete the challenge.
6.  The zipper does not open, follow steps 2 - 4 until you open the zipper.

This is a quick and easy challenge we were able to achieve in less than 10 minutes to complete. I am curious if this will work with my match luggage that I have in the closet. For those who may be reading this, my combination is not 1,2,3,4,5.

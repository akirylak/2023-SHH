# 2023 SANS Holiday Hack
## Chapter 1 Challenge: Holiday Hack Orientation
### Location: Christmas Island
The boat ride to Christmas Island was extremely quick as I felt like I teleported from the real world into the digital world of the Geese Islands. You can say it was more like a smooth transition rather than smooth sailing. Thankfully I do not get SYN/ACK sick or sea sick.

As I approach closer to the center of the island I am greeted by an elf named **Jingle Ringford** to give me an introduction of what is to come with this yearâ€™s SANS Holiday Hack.

Instructions on how to complete the first challenge were very straight forward. As a person who has completed previous CTF challenges, the objective to click on the upper panel of the terminal window and type answer and press Enter on the keyboard was very straightforward.
If completing the first challenge was this easy, I have a gut feeling, filled with Flaming Hot Cheetos and coffee that completing the challenges should be very straightforward.
